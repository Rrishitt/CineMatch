# 🎬 CineMatch

Picking a movie shouldn’t feel like a full-time job.

**CineMatch** helps you stop scrolling, stop arguing, and start watching.  
Tell it what you like — CineMatch finds movies that actually match your vibe.

Less “meh”. More “this is perfect”.

## 😵 The Problem

You open a streaming app.  
You scroll for 20 minutes.  
You give up and rewatch the same movie.

We’ve all been there.
